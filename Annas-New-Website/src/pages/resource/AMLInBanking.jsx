            AML
          </a>{" "}
          stands for Anti-Money Laundering, which is a set of laws, regulations,
          and procedures that financial institutions must follow to prevent
          money laundering and other financial crimes.
          <br /><br />
          Money laundering is the process of disguising the proceeds of criminal activity as legitimate
          funds, which can then be used to finance further criminal activity or
          to evade taxes.
          <br /><br />
          AML regulations require financial institutions to
          develop and implement risk-based policies, procedures, and controls to
          detect, prevent, and report money laundering activities.
          <br /><br />
          The main components of an AML program include:
          <br /><br />
          Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Financial institutions are required to identify and verify the
          identity of their customers and to assess the risk of doing business
          with them.
          <br /><br />
          This includes collecting and verifying customer
          identification information, conducting ongoing monitoring of customer
          transactions, and conducting enhanced due diligence for high-risk
          customers.
          <br /><br />
          Suspicious Activity Monitoring and Reporting: Financial
          institutions must monitor customer transactions for unusual or
          suspicious activity and report any suspicious transactions to the
          relevant authorities.
          <br /><br />
          AML Training and Awareness: Financial
          institutions must train their employees on AML laws and regulations
          and maintain an AML program that is up-to-date with regulatory
          requirements.
          <br /><br />
          Record Keeping: Financial institutions must maintain
          accurate records of customer identification information, transactions,
          and AML program activities.
          <br /><br />
          AML Risk Assessment: Financial
          institutions must conduct a periodic risk assessment to identify,
          evaluate, and mitigate AML risks. AML is a critical part of a
          financial institutionâ€™s compliance and risk management framework.
          <br /><br />
          AML regulations help to prevent money laundering, terrorism financing,
          fraud, and other financial crimes, and help to maintain the integrity
          of the financial system.
