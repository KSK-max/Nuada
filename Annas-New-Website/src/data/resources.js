Ongoing Monitoring: Banks are required to monitor their merchant customers’ transactions and activities on an ongoing basis to detect any unusual or suspicious activity, and to report any suspicious transactions to the relevant authorities.

      "AML stands for Anti-Money Laundering, which is a set of laws, regulations, and procedures that financial institutions must follow to prevent money laundering and other financial crimes. Money laundering is the process of disguising the proceeds of criminal activity as legitimate funds, which can then be used to finance further criminal activity or to evade taxes.

The main components of an AML program include: Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Financial institutions are required to identify and verify the identity of their customers and to assess the risk of doing business with them. This includes collecting and verifying customer identification information, conducting ongoing monitoring of customer transactions, and conducting enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers. Suspicious Activity Monitoring and Reporting: Financial institutions must monitor customer transactions for unusual or suspicious activity and report any suspicious transactions to the relevant authorities. AML Training and Awareness: Financial institutions must train their employees on AML laws and regulations and maintain an AML program that is up-to-date with regulatory requirements. Record Keeping: Financial institutions must maintain accurate records of customer identification information, transactions, and AML program activities. AML Risk Assessment: Financial institutions must conduct a periodic risk assessment to identify, evaluate, and mitigate AML risks. AML is a critical part of a financial institution’s compliance and risk management framework. AML regulations help to prevent money laundering, terrorism financing, fraud, and other financial crimes, and help to maintain the integrity of the financial system.",
